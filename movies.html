                    <br>
                    <p>The first film in the franchise Hellraiser tells the story of a college student her father
                        ,stepmother and the uncle who resurfaces after being taken to hell by the Cenobites led by
                        Pinhead. Clive Barker weaves a terrifying tale around realism and fantasy which stands as a
                        strong horror film. A lot of the series tropes originate from this film and while I like the
                        second better there is no denying this movies impact on the genre. The movie is gory and full of
                        great special effects and makeup work. It also has one of the most amazing stop motion effects I
                        have ever seen. Great movie and easy to find definitely watch it if you haven't seen it already.

                    <p>This movie is beyond dreadful, it honestly had me laughing harder then any modern day comedy has.
                        It’s so incredibly horrible that it’s good. The ending battle sequence had me laughing
                        hysterically. I was literally crying laughing. Now look, I’m only a 17 year old guy and I find
                        humor in some really stupid stuff. So if your somebody that doesn’t find humor in stupid things
                        then I definitely would not watch this movie. But if your someone that likes stuff that’s so
                        stupid that it’s funny and things that are so bad that they’re good, then I’d say you will
                        probably laugh pretty hard while watching this film.</p>

                    <p>Wes Craven experimented with the idea of "meta-horror" back in 1994 with A New Nightmare, a film
                        which I loved, as it was a breath of fresh hair in the horror genre. But ultimately, I think
                        that this idea was mastered just two years later with Scream. This film is a brilliant satirical
                        criticism of the horror tropes that have been beaten to death throughout the 80's and early
                        90's, but it doesn't become a parody. It definitely delivers on it's horror elements that are
                        enough to impress both sides of the horror fan spectrum. It never becomes cheesy, though. It's
                        really clever actually. And way ahead of it's time. </p>
